## Arrays

### Creating Arrays

Here are two basic arrays:

```ruby
num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]
```

An array can also be created by calling the `Array.new` method

```ruby
Array.new               #=> []
Array.new(3)            #=> [nil, nil, nil]
Array.new(3, 7)         #=> [7, 7, 7]
Array.new(3, true)      #=> [true, true, true]
```

### Accessing Elements

Every element in an array has an **index**. Ruby arrays use **zero-based indexing**, which means that the index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on. Accessing a specific element within an array is as simple as calling `myArray[x]`, where `x` is the index of the element you want. Calling an invalid position will result in `nil`. Ruby also allows the use of negative indices, which return elements starting from the *end* of an array, starting at `[-1]`.

```ruby
str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]

str_array[0]            #=> "This"
str_array[1]            #=> "is"
str_array[4]            #=> "array"
str_array[-1]           #=> "array"
str_array[-2]           #=> "small"
```

Ruby provides the `#first` and `#last` array methods

```ruby
str_array = ["This", "is", "a", "small", "array"]

str_array.first         #=> "This"
str_array.first(2)      #=> ["This", "is"]
str_array.last(2)       #=> ["small", "array"]
```

### Adding and Removing Elements

Adding an element to an existing array is as simple as using the `#push` method or the shovel operator `<<`. Both methods will add elements to the end of an array and return that array with the new elements. The `#pop` method will remove the element at the end of an array and return the element that was removed.

```ruby
num_array = [1, 2]

num_array.push(3, 4)      #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
num_array << 5            #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
num_array.pop             #=> 5
num_array                 #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The methods `#shift` and `#unshift` are used to add and remove elements at the beginning of an array. The `#unshift`method adds elements to the beginning of an array and returns that array (much like `#push`). The `#shift` method removes the first element of an array and returns that element (much like `#pop`).

```ruby
num_array = [2, 3, 4]

num_array.unshift(1)      #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
num_array.shift           #=> 1
num_array                 #=> [2, 3, 4]
```

Itâ€™s also useful to know that both `#pop` and `#shift` can take integer arguments:

```ruby
num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

num_array.pop(3)          #=> [4, 5, 6]
num_array.shift(2)        #=> [1, 2]
num_array                 #=> [3]
```

### Adding and Subtracting Arrays

The `concat` method works the same way as `[1, 2, 3] + [3, 4, 5]`

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 4, 5]

a + b         #=> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
a.concat(b)   #=> [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
```

To find the difference between two arrays, you can **subtract** them using `-`. This method returns a copy of the first array, removing any elements that appear in the second array.

```ruby
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] - [1, 4]  #=> [2, 2, 3]
```

### Basic Methods

#### Some of the common Array Methods

```ruby
[].empty?               #=> true
[[]].empty?             #=> false
[1, 2].empty?           #=> false

[1, 2, 3].length        #=> 3

[1, 2, 3].reverse       #=> [3, 2, 1]

[1, 2, 3].include?(3)   #=> true
[1, 2, 3].include?("3") #=> false

[1, 2, 3].join          #=> "123"
[1, 2, 3].join("-")     #=> "1-2-3"
```
